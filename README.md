Changes in this version of logisim
----------------------------------

### Improved snapping of text objects in the appearance editor

When dragging a text object while holding down the Control key, the point on
the object that is snapped to the grid depends on the alignment properties of
the text. This makes it easier to position the text nicely in relation to
wire attachment points and other features of your circuit symbol.
