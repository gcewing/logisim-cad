Logisim-CAD
===========

This is a fork of logisim-evolution with some features making it easier
to use for designing circuits to be built with real parts. amd to help
produce nice-looking schematics.

Rendering Improvements
----------------------

Some refinements have been made to the rendering of schematics to improve
their appearance. Port and junction dots are centred on wires properly, and
some gate shapes have been adjusted slightly so that their outlines are
aligned better with the grid. Port dots on component symbols are only
displayed when a port does not have a wire attached to it.

Some options have been added, on a new Rendering tab of the Project Options
window:

* Base Stroke Width

The width of single-bit lines and component outlines. The widths of buses
and other features are calculated relative to this.

* Hide Abutted Ports

Prevents port dots from being displayed where two components connect
directly without an intervening wire.

Improvements to the Appearance Editor
-------------------------------------

### Improved snapping of text objects

When dragging a text object with snapping, the point on
the object that is snapped to the grid depends on the alignment attributes of
the text. This makes it easier to position the text nicely in relation to
wire attachment points and other features of your circuit symbol.

Text objects also have a Margin attribute that leaves a horizontal offset
between the text and the grid point that it snaps to. This allows you to
easily position text next to a box with suitable spacing.

These features are backwards-compatible -- if a circuit that uses them is
loaded into a standard version of Logisim-evolution, text objects will
still appear in the same place.

### Finer snapping grid

The snapping grid for all objects except ports
and the origin marker is half the size of the wire grid. This makes it
easy, for example, to line up an inversion circle with a wire properly.

This feature is backwards-compatible.

### Option to snap by default

There is an application preference to reverse the action of the Control key,
so that snapping is the default, and holding Control prevents snapping.

This feature is backwards-compatible.

### Circular arcs

The Curve object has an option to render it as a circular or elliptical arc
instead of a quadratic bezier curve.

This feature is partially backwards-compatible. Standard Logisim-evolution will
render the arc as a quadratic bezier having the same control points, which will
look approximately right but a bit wonky.

### Pin numbers and port labels

A pin number can be assigned to an input or output. Both the pin label and the
pin number can be automatically shown next to the port on the circuit symbol,
with options for positioning.

Standard Logisim-evolution will show the automatic pin labels (but not numbers)
as ordinary text objects, not linked to the port.

### Variants

Often a part contains a number of independent units, such as a quad gate or
dual flip-flop. The same circuit symbol can be used for each unit, but the pin
numbers are different. To accommodate this, Logisim-CAD has the concept of
variants.

Circuits have a Variant List attribute that can contain a list of variant names,
and instances have a Variant attribute that selects one of the variants. The
Pin Number attribute of a port can consist of a comma-separated list of pin
numbers corresponding to each variant. Then the circuit symbol shows the
appropriate pin numbers for the selected variant.

### Component Designations

Two new circuit attributes help with generating labels for components:
Designation Prefix (shared between instances) and Serial Number (per instance).
When the Label attribute is empty and a Serial Number is provided, a label
is generated by concatenating the Designation Prefix, Serial Number and
Variant.
